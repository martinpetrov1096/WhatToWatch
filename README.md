## Multiplayer

## Filtering

## Voting

## Viewing the Cast, Ratings, and Reviews





This is just a small site I put together to help friends agree on what to watch by swiping on
movies 'tinder style'. To get started, head over to this [url](https://whattowatch.martin-petrov.com) 
and click 'start', or 'join' if someone else already created a lobby. While waiting on everyone
to join, users can narrow down what movies WTW suggests by specifying which genres they want
to watch, or giving a minimum rating. Users can also get TV suggestions instead of movies.After
someone in the lobby clicks 'start', WTW will switch over to the 'vote' view. Here users can 
vote on whether they are willing watch by swiping left or right on movie/tv-shows. If a user 
clicks on the overview tab, they will see the total number of votes each movie they voted on 
recieved. WTW will keep suggesting movies until either it has run out of suggestions, or the
users reach a verbal consensus
